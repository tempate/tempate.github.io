### About me

I am Master's student in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki. My research interests are (in no particular order):

**Mathematics:**
  * Model Theory
  * Proof Theory
  * Type Theory
  * Algebraic Topology

**Computer Science:**
  * Automated Deduction
  * Formally Explainable Machine Learning
  * Natural Language Processing
  * Brain-Computer Interfaces
  * Formal Methods
  * Algorithms

Outside of work and studies, I like to run, hike, travel, read, write, and play chess and go. I also recently started learning to play the piano.
