I am Master's student in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Helsinki. My research interests are (in no particular order):

**Mathematics:**
<ul>
  <li>Model Theory</li>
  <li>Proof Theory</li>
  <li>Type Theory</li>
  <li>Algebraic Topology</li>
</ul>

**Computer Science:**
<ul>
  <li>Automated Deduction</li>
  <li>Formally Explainable Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
  <li>Brain-Computer Interfaces</li>
  <li>Formal Methods</li>
  <li>Algorithms</li>
</ul>

Outside of work and studies, I like to run, hike, travel, read, write, and play chess and go. I also recently started learning to play the piano.
